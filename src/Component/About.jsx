        <p>
          At <strong>Sound Mack</strong>, music is not just sound â€” 
          it is an experience. Every beat, lyric, and melody has the power 
          to inspire, heal, and connect people from all walks of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to create a space where artists and listeners come together, 
          sharing the magic of music and building a community through rhythm and harmony.
